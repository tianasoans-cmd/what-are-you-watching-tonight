What are you watching tonight?

‘What are you watching tonight?’ is a Python project to help users decide what to watch on Disney+. It gives users Movie and TV show recommendations based on selected genres and types of content they are in the mood for. 

**General Information**

With endless titles and streaming services it is often overwhelming to select something to watch. This project enables users to select a few of their preferred choices and receive a movie recommendation tailored to their preferences

The project also aims to help users discover something new to watch, saving them from yet another re-watch of their favourites. Ultimately, making the most of their expensive Disney+ subscription.

- Modules including;
- Pandas

**Improvements**

Despite the code being completed, I believe there are areas for improvement. This includes: 

- Finding a more recent dataset
- Removing genres that don’t exist for either type of movie when selecting 

I also believe that there are a range of features that could be added to improve this code. Including but not limited to:

- Adding poster images of each film 
- Adding the main cast of the title in the description
